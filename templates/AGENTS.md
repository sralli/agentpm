## Orchestrated workflow

This project uses **agendum** MCP tools for structured task management. Agents follow a mandatory pipeline for all non-trivial work.

### Pipeline overview

```

### Phase 1: Orient

At session start, run:
1. `pm_board_status` — see all projects, task counts, recent activity
2. `pm_memory_search` — recover decisions and context from prior sessions
3. `pm_task_list` on the relevant project — see pending work

### Phase 2: Plan

1. Use the harness plan mode (Claude Code `ExitPlanMode`, Cursor plan, etc.) to design the approach.
2. Once the human approves, translate the plan into agendum tasks:
   ```
   pm_orchestrate_plan(
     project="myproject",
     goal="...",
     tasks_json="[{title, description, depends_on_indices, acceptance_criteria, key_files}, ...]"
   )
   ```
3. Auto-approve since the harness already handled human review:
   ```
   pm_orchestrate_approve(project="myproject", plan_id="plan-001")
   ```

### Phase 3: Dispatch

For each task in the plan (respecting dependency order):

1. `pm_orchestrate_next(project, plan_id)` — get the next task + context packet
2. Spawn a subagent with the context packet:
   ```
   Agent(prompt="<context packet content>", subagent_type="general-purpose")
   ```
3. The subagent:
   - Reads the context packet (goal, acceptance criteria, key files, constraints)
   - Implements the change
   - Runs tests relevant to the change
   - Calls `pm_orchestrate_report(project, task_id, plan_id, status, ...)` when done

### Phase 4: Review

After each task report:

1. **Spec review** — check against acceptance criteria:
   ```
   pm_orchestrate_review(project, task_id, stage="spec", passed=true/false, issues="...")
   ```
2. **Quality review** — check code quality, conventions, coverage:
   ```
   pm_orchestrate_review(project, task_id, stage="quality", passed=true/false, issues="...")
   ```

If either review fails:
- Task returns to `in_progress`
- Issues are logged as progress entries
- Subagent (or new subagent) addresses the issues
- Re-reports → re-review

If both pass:
- Task marked `done` and auto-archived
- Dependents unblocked automatically

### Phase 5: Completion

1. `pm_orchestrate_status(project, plan_id)` — verify all tasks done
2. Run full test suite and lint
3. `pm_memory_write` — persist any decisions or gotchas learned
4. Commit

## Subagent contract

Subagents dispatched via the orchestrator MUST:

| Requirement | How |
|---|---|
| Stay scoped | Only modify files listed in context packet or directly related |
| Report back | Call `pm_orchestrate_report` with accurate status |
| Log progress | Use `pm_task_progress` for intermediate updates |
| Handle blockers | Report `blocked` status with clear reason, don't silently fail |
| Test changes | Run relevant tests before reporting `done` |

Subagents MUST NOT:
- Skip reporting (silent completion breaks the pipeline)
- Modify unrelated files (scope creep breaks review)
- Mark tasks done without testing

## Task lifecycle

```
pending → in_progress → review → done (auto-archived)
                ↑          │
                └──────────┘  (review failed)

pending → blocked (dependency unmet or external blocker)
              │
              └→ pending (auto-unblocked when dependency completes)
```

## When to skip orchestration

| Scenario | Orchestration? |
|---|---|
| Typo fix, version bump | No — just edit, test, commit |
| Single-file bug fix | No — but log with `pm_task_progress` if tracked |
| Multi-file feature | Yes — full pipeline |
| Refactor touching 3+ files | Yes — full pipeline |
| Research / exploration | No — but save findings to `pm_memory_write` |

## Memory and continuity

- `pm_memory_write(project, key, content)` — persist decisions, patterns, gotchas
- `pm_memory_append(project, key, content)` — add to existing memory
- `pm_memory_search(project, query)` — find relevant memories
- `pm_task_handoff(project, task_id, ...)` — structured handoff for incomplete tasks

Use memory for things that aren't obvious from code: "we chose X over Y because...", "this broke before when...", "the stakeholder wants...".

## Model tier mapping

Configure tiers via `pm_orchestrate_policy`. Tasks are auto-scored for complexity at creation time.

| Tier | Suggested Model | Use For |
|------|----------------|---------|
| large | claude-opus-4-6 / gpt-5.4 | Architecture, complex multi-file code, planning |
| default | claude-sonnet-4-6 | Standard dev, most tasks |
| fast | claude-haiku-4-5 | Docs, email, simple fixes, trivial changes |
| review | claude-sonnet-4-6 | Code review (use a different model than the writer) |

Example policy:
```
pm_orchestrate_policy(project="myapp",
  model_default="default",
  model_review="review",
  model_by_category='{"code-complex": "large", "code-simple": "fast", "docs": "fast"}',
  model_by_priority='{"critical": "large"}')
```
